# What is Stellar Station?

Learn the core tenets of Stellar Station.

## Design Principles

### Streamlined

Stellar Station, first and foremost, is a streamlined take on the Space Station experience.

Lengthy tutorials or large lore pages should not be needed for new players.
The UI and mechanics of the game should lead players to understanding the game and a good experience.

### Social

Stellar Station is a *social* game.

While mechanics can and do go in depth, these mechanics seek to bring players together, not to isolate them in their own minigames.

The fun of Stellar Station comes from many small interactions coalescing into overall narratives.

### Emergent

Stellar Station seeks to have mechanics that build together in unique configurations, rather than gating interactions behind arbitrary and scenario-specific mechanics.

Interactions should seek to generate as many possible scenarios with as few mechanics as possible.

### Active Progression

Stellar Station is not a game that can amble for hours on end.

Rounds last 1 hour and 30 minutes at most, and the progression of various factions can speed this up.

Designated antagonists are not the only ones with proactive goals that drive the round.
