# Gorlex Operatives

Carmine, echion, cruor. Antagonists on a team with a set operation.

## Nuclear Operatives

Similar to Nukeops in standard SS14.

### Changes

- Nuclear fission explosive is always on the operators' ship
- Nuclear fission explosive must be planted at a specific, random location
- Nuclear fission explosive does not have a disk
- Arming takes longer
- Moving the nuke is slower

### Reasoning

No nuke disk means nuke disk hiding/griefing is wholly impossible. This was a mechanical concern regarding wallening.

No nuke disk means no "no captain, ez win" and also no "captain killed immediately so chain of command falls apart."

Nuke needing to be brought to a random predetermined beacon location makes it harder, if not outright impossible, for nukies to sequester in an easy-to-defend position.

## Monkey Operatives

Uh oh.
Gorlex ran out of budget to hire operatives.
All nuclear operatives spawn as monkeys instead of actual people, and the nukeops team is preallocated extra simian reinforcement beacons.
Mission objective is the same as Nuclear Ops.

## Adoption Operatives

Gorlex isn't here for the nuke- It's here to forcibly adopt your animals!
..Probably because someone ran out of animals for animal testing.
Acquire X number of station pets or animals, then exfiltrate the sector.

The operatives recieve special Gorlex Pet Carriers to complete this operation.

## Retrieval Operatives

Several gorlex sleeper agents need exfiltrating from hostile territory!
Retrieve X specified traitors from the station.
Deaths are penalized. (Antagonist crossover gameplay!)

## Vault Operatives

Gorlex Arms Incorporated wants Nanotrasen's corporate secrets.
Breach into The Vault and steal several special duffle bags full of crucial research data.
The duffle bags are very heavy and slow you down.

The Echion Drill must be hauled from the Gorlex ship to the vault, where it must drill for 4 and a half minutes to breach into the secret "secure subfloor" where the research data is located.
