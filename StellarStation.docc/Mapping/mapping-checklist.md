# Mapping Checklist

Ensure your map adheres to basic Stellar standards.

## Tileset

If there's a Stellar and a non-Stellar asset, make sure to use the Stellar asset.
Non-Stellar assets should ideally be abstracted or removed by the developers, but sometimes, this isn't possible.

## Wall-mounted items

Things mounted on walls are generally harder to see than those on the floor.
Use functional wallmounts sparingly, with the following exceptions being okay as mostly wallmounts:
- APCs
- Lighting
- Air Alarms
- Room Signage

Decorative wallmounts are fine to use.

## Stairs

Ensure that stairs have their sides and edges capped off using half-wall pieces for a proper illusion of depth.

## AI

AI cores should not be located on exterior satellites or other easy-to-remove areas of the station.

## Items not present in Stellar

We do not have Chapels.
