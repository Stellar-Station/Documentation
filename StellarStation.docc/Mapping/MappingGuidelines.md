# Mapping Guidelines

Learn the best way to put together maps for Stellar.

## General Flow

Due to the perspective of our 3:4 walls, corridors should generally be oriented horizontally.
Vertical corridors are harder to adequately fill with elements and may be obscured, even with wall cutaway.

## Use The Right Things

If there's a Stellar and a non-Stellar asset, make sure to use the Stellar asset.
Non-Stellar assets should ideally be abstracted or removed.

## Wallmounts

Things mounted on walls are generally harder to see than those on the floor.
Use functional wallmounts sparingly, with the following exceptions being okay as mostly wallmounts:
- APCs
- Lighting
- Air Alarms
- Room Signage

Decorative wallmounts are fine to use.

## Stairs

Ensure that stairs have their sides and edges capped off using half-wall pieces for a proper illusion of depth.

## AI

AI cores should not be located on exterior satellites or other easy-to-remove areas of the station.

## Things We Don't Have

We do not have Chapels.
