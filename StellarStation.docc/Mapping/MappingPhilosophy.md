# Mapping Philosophy

Put together maps that adhere to the design and philosophy of Stellar

## Flow Is Key

The most important thing to consider in Stellar when designing a map is flow.

Flow dictates how players move around the space, both crew-sided and otherwise.

## Bring Players Together

The flow of a map should generally seek to bring players together by default, instead of isolating them.

Departments should be largely accessible and visible to all players within a round, not just their members.
Players should seldom run into a scenario where they go to a department's front desk or lobby and they're unable to reach anyone inside.

Departments should generally not have breakrooms or other features that encourage department members to congregate in an isolated manner, except for when isolation is explicitly the goal.

## Isolation Is Intentional

Players should be able to slip out of the all-seeing eyes of the hustle and bustle of the station as they need.

Departments should have a few backrooms.
Maintenance should be plentiful, with both many pathways to get lost in, as well as rooms to sequester in should you need a isolated place.

## Wallening

Due to the perspective of our 3:4 walls, corridors should generally be oriented horizontally.
Vertical corridors are harder to adequately fill with elements and may be obscured, even with wall cutaway.
